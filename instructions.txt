register = any register, 0-3



LOD	- Load operand into register


STO	- Store register into memory address (no immediate)


ADD - Add operand to accumulator; result in register


SUB	- Subtract operand from accumulator; result in register


ADR - Add register to accumulator; result in accumulator


SUR - Subtract register from accumulator; result in accumulator


AND - 'And' the operand with the accumulator; result in register


IOR - 'Or' the operand with the accumulator; result in register


NOT - 'Not' the register; result in register


JMP - Set the PC to the immediate value unconditionally


JEQ - Set the PC to the immediate value if the CC = 2


JGT - Set the PC to the immediate value if the CC = 1


JLT - Set the PC to the immediate value if the CC = 4


CMP - Set the CC based on the value of register


CLR - Clear the register


HLT - Set halt flag = 1
